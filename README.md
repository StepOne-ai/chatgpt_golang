# ü§ñ OpenAI Go Module

Welcome to the **OpenAI Go Module**! This Go module allows you to easily interact with any OpenAI model and view your API balance. It's designed to be simple, fast, and easy to integrate into your existing Go projects. üöÄ

## Features

- üéØ **Interact with OpenAI Models**: Send requests to OpenAI models like `GPT-4`, `DALL-E`, or `Whisper` for language generation, image generation, or audio transcription.
- üí∏ **Check Your OpenAI API Balance**: Keep track of your usage and view your available balance programmatically.
- ‚ö° **Fast and Efficient**: Built with Go's concurrency model for optimal performance.

## Installation

To install the module, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/openai-go-module
```

## Usage

### Interacting with OpenAI Models

To interact with OpenAI models, simply import the module and use the relevant functions:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/yourusername/openai-go-module"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the client with your OpenAI API key
    client := openai.NewClient("your-api-key")

    // Call OpenAI model
    response, err := client.CallModel("gpt-4", "Translate this text to French")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Response from OpenAI:", response)
}
```

### Checking Your OpenAI API Balance

You can also check your API balance using this module:

```go
balance, err := client.CheckBalance()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    return
}

fmt.Printf("Your current balance is: $%.2f\n", balance)
```

## Configuration

Make sure to set your OpenAI API key in your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Alternatively, you can pass the API key directly when initializing the client.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you'd like to contribute to the module. Contributions are always welcome! üéâ
